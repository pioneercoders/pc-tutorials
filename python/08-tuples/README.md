<h4>What is tuples ? </h4>
Tuples are Immutable Sequences, we cannot change the elements of a tuple once assigned.

```python
# Create a tuple "weekdays" with "monday", "tuesday" etc.
weekdays = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") 

# Display the second object in the tuple
print(weekdays[1])

```
<h4>Why we need tuples ?</h4>
When we have non modifiable sequence of elements then we can go for tuples.
