## Other comparing operators

So far we've used `==`, but there are other operators also. This list
probably looks awfully long, but it's actually quite easy to learn.

| Usage     | Description                       | True examples         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `a == b`  | a is equal to b                   | `1 == 1`              |
| `a != b`  | a is not equal to b               | `1 != 2`              |
| `a > b`   | a is greater than b               | `2 > 1`               |
| `a >= b`  | a is greater than or equal to b   | `2 >= 1`, `1 >= 1`    |
| `a < b`   | a is less than b                  | `1 < 2`               |
| `a <= b`  | a is less than or equal to b      | `1 <= 2`, `1 <= 1`    |

We can also combine multiple comparisons. This table assumes that a and
b are Booleans.

| Usage     | Description                               | True example                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `a and b` | a is True and b is True                   | `1 == 1 and 2 == 2`               |
| `a or b`  | a is True, b is True or they're both True | `False or 1 == 1`, `True or True` |

`not` can be used for negations. If `value` is True, `not value` is
False, and if `value` is False, `not value` is True.

There's also `is`, but don't use it instead of `==` unless you know
what you are doing. We'll learn more about it later.
