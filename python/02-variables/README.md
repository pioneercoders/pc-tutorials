## Variables

A variable is a reserved memory location to store values.

```python
data = 1   # create a variable called data that points to 1
print(data)
sum = 10 + 20;
print(sum)
```

When assigning something to a variable using a `=`, the right side of
the `=` is always executed before the left side. This means that we can
do something with a variable on the right side, then assign the result
back to the same variable on the left side.

```python
a = 1
a = a + 1
print(a)
```

<h4>Strings</h4>
Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.

```python
mystring = 'Welcome to pioneer coders'
print(mystring)
```

## Booleans

There are two Boolean values, True and False.

```python
isProcessing = false;
print(isProcessing)
```

## None

None is Python's "nothing" value. It behaves just like any other value,
and it's often used as a default value for different kinds of things.
Right now it might seem useless but we'll find a bunch of ways to use
None later.

```python
thingy = None
print(thingy)
```
