<h4> Variables </h4>

A variable is a reserved memory location to store values, usually it stores in RAM. We can change value as per our need in program.

```python
data = 1   # create a variable called data that points to 1
print(data)
sum = 10 + 20
print(sum)
``` 

<h4>Strings</h4>
Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.

```python
mystring = 'Welcome to pioneer coders'
print(mystring)
```

<h4> Booleans</h4>

There are two Boolean values, True and False.

```python
isProcessing = False
print(isProcessing)
```

<h4> None </h4>

None is Python's "nothing" value. It behaves just like any other value,
and it's often used as a default value for different kinds of things.
Right now it might seem useless but we'll find a bunch of ways to use
None later.

```python
thingy = None
print(thingy)
```
