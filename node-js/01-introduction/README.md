<h4>What is NodeJS</h4>
<p>Node.js is an JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.</p>
<h4>Official Definition</h4>
<p>Node.js a JavaScript runtime built on <b>Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine</b>. Node.js uses an <b>event-driven, non-blocking I/O model</b> that makes it lightweight and efficient. </p>
<p><b>What is Non-blocking</b></p>
<p>functions in Node.js are designed to be non-blocking (commands execute in parallel, and use callbacks to signal completion or failure)
<p> Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of modules that handle various core functionality.</p>

	Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library 
</p>
<h4>Node.js Features</h4>
<p><b>Very Fast: </b> Since Node is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library very fast in code execution.   </p>
<p><b>Asynchronous and Event Driven: </b>Asynchronous means Node.js executes its functions Asynchronously (eliminates waiting time). Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call</p>
<p><b>Single Threaded: </b> Follows a single threaded model with event looping.</p>
<p><b>Open source: </b> Node.js is free</p>
<p><b>No buffering: </b>Node.js applications never buffer any data.</p>
