<p>Javascript is a full-fledged object based dynamic programming language. Javscript can be included in the web pages to make them more dynamic and interactive.</p>

<h4>Who developed javascript?</h4>
		
<p>JavaScript developed 1995 by <span style="color:blue">Brendan Eich</span>, who was worked at Netscape, now it is Mozilla. In earlier, javascript  known as Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted.</p>

<h4>Javscript Feature</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Light Weighted</li>
		<li>Object Based(support for objects)</li>
		<li>Interpreted</li>
		<li>High Level</li>
		<li>Client Side Technology</li>
		<li>Client side(user's input) validation</li>
		<li>Case Sensitive</li>
		<li>Built-in Functions, etc</li>		
	</ul>

<h4>Light Weighted</h4>
<p>Javascript is lightweight because it is to learn and understand.</p>
<h4>Object Based</h4>
<p>JS(javscript) supports objects(JS object is a collection of properties. The properties are key value pairs).</p>
<h4>Client Side Technology</h4>
<p>JS is a client side technology becuase it runs on client(machine) browser</p>
<h4>Client side validation</h4>
<p>JS offers user's input validation. if user's input validation is not there then when user the submits data, the data travels across the network. After  that it will validate with the data present in the database.This process increases the 
network traffic and it  interacts with data base for every users's input to validate the data this decreases the performance of the server.To avoid this we can use Javascript to validate users data(less interaction with the server).</p>

<h4>Client-side JavaScript</h4>
<p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.</p>
<p>It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.</p>

<p>The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.</p>

<p>The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.</p>

<p>JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.</p>

<h4>Advantages of JavaScript </h4>
<p>Javascript used for creating visual based effects(animations and sliders), calculating the data etc.</p>
<p><b>Less server interaction </b>Javascript validates user input before sending the it to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.</p>

<p><b>Immediate feedback to the visitors  </b>They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.</p>

<p><b>Increased interactivity </b>You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.</p>

<p><b>Richer interfaces </b> </bJavaScript has a capability to include the components like drag-and-drop, sliders and animations to provide a Rich Interface to the site visitors.</p>

<h4>Limitations of JavaScript</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Security</li>
	<li>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.</li>
	<li>JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h4>JavaScript Development Tools</h4>
<p>TO write the javascript code we can use any text editor like notepad,wordpad, notepadd++, Sublime Text Atom and so on.</p>

<h4>Where is JavaScript Today ?</h4>

<p>The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor. </p>

<p>Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript confirm to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.</p>
