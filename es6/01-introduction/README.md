<h4>What is ES6? </h4>
ES6 or ECMAScript6 or ECMAScript(2015) is trademarked specification standardized by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). As JavaScript popularity was rising and it has to be run on most of the browsers there was a need for a single platform where all new JavaScript features could be standardized thus ECMAScript was formed.

<h4>How ES6 defferent than JS? </h4> 
ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.

ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard.  ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of these features in major JavaScript engines.
